Final Projects Completed on freeCodeCamp.com

This was the final project completed on freeCodeCamp on their responsive web design course. I am extremely happy with the result albeit there are some things that could be done using better methods such as flex design instead of media queries. 

I am uploading this to GitHub even though I completed this about 2 months ago seeing as I am learning how to use GitHub now and I plan to use some aspects of this code in my actual portfolio page when I begin to build it once I finish The Odin Project's foundation course, particularly the menu and the main hero as I feel perfectly ok with how they turned out.

A lot more can be done with how this page looks, and I am excited to do in the near future.
